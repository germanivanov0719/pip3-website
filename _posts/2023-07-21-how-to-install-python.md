This project is about Python packages. But is the valuable information presented here worth reading if you don't have Python installed? Of course not! So follow this simple guide to install Python 3 on your system.

## Install on Windows

1. Just install Linux.
2. Follow the [guide for linux](#install-on-linux).

## Install on Linux

1. Python is already installed. Just write `python3` in your terminal and use it!

## Install on macOS

1. Yeah, you can just use homebrew to install python, but who cares when you can simply install Linux?
2. Already done? Follow [this guide](#install-on-linux).

## How to test if Python is installed correctly?

Just write this code to `main.py`:

```python
from math import sqrt

print("Hello, World!")
print("sqrt(2) is approximately", sqrt(2))
```

However, if you're too lazy to do that, we have good news for you: we've already prepared [a file](/storage/main.py) for you to run!
